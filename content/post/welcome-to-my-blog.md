Hello! Welcome to my personal Blog. I hope to share with you here a little about what I have gone through in my life. Your opinions and comments are more than welcome, so feel free to share them with everyone!

### Who am I?

Why do you read my blog? For who I am or for content? I write this blog anonymously not because I do not want people to know who I am but because I want this blog to be a place I can explain my thoughts, my ideas.


### Why am I writing this blog?

I blog because it gives me freedom to express in whatever way I feel right.

### What will I be blogging about?
  
I will post on a variety of different topics. But I will focus on some topics, example:

* Learning English (My English skill is not good, so I will write all in English. Practice make perfect, right?)
* My Thoughts, My Feelings and My Life. (same as other personal blogs)
* Some technology (I'm a web developer)

### How can you leave feedback?

You can leave your comments. For private please email to me, my email address is: ...
